# Changelog

All notable changes to TradeOS are recorded here, sprint by sprint, per
`docs/09_TRADEOS_IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER_PLAN.md`.

## Sprint 0.1 — Backend Skeleton & Event Infrastructure

Phase 0 of the Implementation Master Plan. Scope: stand up the Modular
Monolith's module-folder structure (`TRADEOS_BACKEND_BLUEPRINT.md` §16) and
the in-process Domain Event dispatcher + `platform.event_log` writer.

### Added
- Backend project bootstrap (Poetry, Alembic, Docker Compose for
  PostgreSQL 16) per `TRADEOS_TECHNICAL_STACK.md`.
- Empty module-first scaffolding for all 9 Bounded Contexts (`identity`,
  `preferences`, `trading`, `evaluation`, `configuration`, `playbook`,
  `mistakes`, `statistics`, `journal`) plus `shared_kernel/`.
- `app/platform/` — in-process synchronous Domain Event dispatcher,
  `event_log` writer, and the `platform.event_log` table (migration
  `0001_create_platform_schema_and_event_log`), matching
  `TRADEOS_DATABASE_DESIGN.md` §6.18 exactly.
- `tests/platform/test_event_dispatcher.py` — proves Sprint 0.1's Exit
  Criteria against a real, ephemeral PostgreSQL instance (Testcontainers).

### Dependency note
`asyncpg` was pinned to `^0.31.0` instead of the originally planned
`^0.29.0`. **This is a compatibility fix, not an architectural or
technology decision:** `asyncpg 0.29.0` ships no prebuilt wheel for
Python 3.14 on Windows, and this development machine has no Microsoft
C++ Build Tools to compile it from source. `asyncpg 0.31.0` publishes a
`cp314-win_amd64` wheel and installs cleanly. SQLAlchemy 2.0 (async) with
the `asyncpg` driver, as mandated by `TRADEOS_TECHNICAL_STACK.md` §7,
is unchanged — only the pinned patch/minor version moved.

### Verification performed
- `poetry install` — 59 packages installed cleanly.
- `alembic upgrade head` — `platform.event_log` created; columns, primary
  key, and all 3 indexes confirmed via direct `psql` inspection.
- `pytest tests/platform/` — 1 passed.
- `ruff format --check` / `ruff check` — clean.
- `mypy app` — clean, after correcting `get_db_session`'s return type
  (`AsyncSession` → `AsyncGenerator[AsyncSession, None]`).

### Deferred
- Sprint 0.2 (auth middleware, correlation IDs) and Sprint 0.3 (frontend
  application shell) — not part of this sprint, per the Master Plan.

## Sprint 0.2 — Auth Middleware & Correlation IDs

Phase 0 of the Implementation Master Plan. Scope: JWT verification at the
Presentation boundary and a correlation ID threaded through every log line
— approved scope also included, at minimum viable size, centralized
exception handling (`TRADEOS_BACKEND_BLUEPRINT.md` §12) to shape the
sprint's own 401 correctly. Explicitly excludes login, registration, users,
roles, and every business module (Phase 1+).

### Added
- `app/platform/context.py` — request-scoped correlation ID / user ID,
  built on `structlog.contextvars` (no second, parallel contextvars
  mechanism).
- `app/platform/logging.py` — `structlog` configuration (JSON, correlation-
  ID bound via `merge_contextvars`), per `TRADEOS_TECHNICAL_STACK.md` §7.
- `app/platform/errors.py` — the one error envelope
  (`TRADEOS_API_SPECIFICATION.md` §8), `AppError`, and a minimal
  `register_exception_handlers()` (`AppError` + catch-all 500 only — no
  domain-invariant or business-validation handling, since no Use Cases
  exist yet).
- `app/platform/security/jwt.py` — `create_access_token` /
  `decode_access_token`, access tokens only (no refresh tokens, no
  password hashing). `create_access_token` is reusable infrastructure for
  the future Login Use Case (Phase 1) — not exposed by any endpoint here.
- `app/platform/security/dependencies.py` — `get_current_user_id`
  dependency for future routes.
- `app/platform/middleware/correlation_id.py`,
  `app/platform/middleware/authentication.py` — plain ASGI middleware
  (not Starlette's `BaseHTTPMiddleware`; see Implementation note).
- `tests/platform/test_jwt.py`,
  `tests/platform/test_authentication_middleware.py`,
  `tests/platform/test_correlation_id_middleware.py` — prove Sprint 0.2's
  Exit Criteria, including that a 401-rejected request is still
  correlation-ID bound.

### Modified
- `app/platform/config.py`, `.env.example` — added `jwt_secret_key`,
  `jwt_algorithm`, `jwt_access_token_expire_minutes`.
- `app/main.py` — wires `configure_logging()`, `register_exception_handlers()`,
  and both middleware (added in an order that makes `CorrelationIdMiddleware`
  outermost — see Implementation note).

### Implementation notes (not architectural decisions)
- **Plain ASGI middleware, not `BaseHTTPMiddleware`:** `BaseHTTPMiddleware`
  runs the downstream app in a separate `anyio` task, which does not
  reliably propagate contextvars set beforehand. Plain ASGI keeps the
  whole request in one call stack/task, so the bound `correlation_id` is
  guaranteed visible everywhere downstream, including inside a 401
  response. This is an implementation detail of "wire JWT verification /
  thread a correlation ID," not a deviation from anything the frozen docs
  specify.
- **Auth middleware builds its 401 response directly**, rather than
  raising and relying on the registered exception handlers: exceptions
  raised inside ASGI middleware run outside Starlette's
  `ExceptionMiddleware` layer and are never delivered to
  `@app.exception_handler`-registered handlers. Both paths use the same
  `build_error_envelope()` helper, so the shape is identical either way.
- **`# type: ignore[import-untyped]` on the `python-jose` import**
  (`app/platform/security/jwt.py`), instead of adding the `types-python-jose`
  stub package. `python-jose` itself is already in the Technical Stack
  (§7); its stub package is not, and is dev-tooling-only (never imported
  at runtime) — adding it felt like exactly the kind of unapproved
  addition the sprint's rules were guarding against, so a type-check
  suppression was used instead.
- **`structlog.testing.capture_logs()` strips the entire processor chain**
  (including `merge_contextvars`), so it cannot capture bound context
  values by design. The correlation-ID tests use a small local helper
  (`capture_logs_with_context()`) that reproduces `capture_logs()`'s
  capture mechanism while keeping `merge_contextvars` in the chain — a
  test-only fix, no production code affected.

### Verification performed
- `pytest tests/` — 14 passed (5 new JWT unit tests, 4 new authentication
  middleware tests, 4 new correlation-ID tests, 1 carried over from
  Sprint 0.1).
- `ruff format --check` / `ruff check` — clean.
- `mypy app` — clean.
- No dependency changes — `python-jose` and `structlog` were already
  present from Sprint 0.1; `poetry install` was not re-run.

### Deferred
- Login, registration, refresh tokens, users, roles, and every business
  module (Phase 1+) — untouched, per approved scope.
- Health endpoint — confirmed out of scope; `TRADEOS_BACKEND_BLUEPRINT.md`
  §11 registers it as Open Question BE-7, explicitly deferred to
  Sprint 9.1 by the Master Plan.

## Sprint 0.3 — Frontend Application Shell

Phase 0 of the Implementation Master Plan. Scope: routing skeleton, the API
client layer, the standard error-envelope handling path, and design system
tokens (dark theme only) — `TRADEOS_FRONTEND_BLUEPRINT.md` §2.2, §2.8, §14.
No feature logic; `frontend/` was built from zero (confirmed empty at
sprint start).

### Added
- Frontend project bootstrap (Vite, React 18, TypeScript strict, Tailwind
  CSS fully configured, ESLint + Prettier) per `TRADEOS_TECHNICAL_STACK.md`
  §6, §9, §11.
- `src/design-system/tokens.css` + `tailwind.config.ts` — dark-theme-only
  color/elevation tokens (`TRADEOS_FRONTEND_BLUEPRINT.md` §14), consumed
  by Tailwind's config rather than hardcoded per component.
- `src/api/errors.ts` (`ApiError`, `parseApiError`, `networkError`) +
  `src/api/client.ts` — the API client layer
  (`TRADEOS_FRONTEND_BLUEPRINT.md` §2.2); only the generic request
  primitive and error normalization exist, no concrete endpoint function
  yet.
- `src/components/ErrorBanner.tsx` + `src/components/ErrorContext.tsx` —
  the one shared error path (§2.8, §17): any future feature module reports
  a failure via `useErrorReporter()`, rendered from exactly one place.
- `src/layout/AppShell.tsx`, `Sidebar.tsx`, `navigation.ts` — sidebar
  grouped Workspace/Analytics/Configuration per §4.1, including the
  visually-present-but-inactive "AI Coach" entry §4.1 explicitly requires.
- `src/router.tsx` + one placeholder page per confirmed frontend module
  (`TRADEOS_FRONTEND_BLUEPRINT.md` §3): Authentication, Dashboard, Trading,
  Evaluation, Configuration, Playbook, Mistakes, Statistics, Journal,
  Settings — 10 modules, one route each. Authentication has no sidebar
  entry (§5.7) and renders outside `AppShell`.
- `src/api/errors.test.ts` — Vitest unit tests for `parseApiError`'s
  normalization logic (pure functions, no component rendering).
- `e2e/error-banner.spec.ts` + `playwright.config.ts` — one Playwright E2E
  test proving the Exit Criteria: a simulated error renders through
  `ErrorBanner` identically from two different routes.
- `src/test-support/errorSimulation.ts` — a dev/test-only hook
  (`window.__tradeosSimulateApiError`) the E2E test calls, since no real
  endpoint exists yet to trigger a genuine failure. Guarded by
  `import.meta.env.DEV`, tree-shaken out of the production build.

### Implementation notes (not architectural decisions)
- **`@testing-library/react` was not added**, per your explicit decision:
  Vitest covers `parseApiError`'s pure logic only; Playwright (already in
  the Technical Stack) covers the actual rendering proof.
- **TanStack Query was not installed** — confirmed out of scope; arrives
  with the first feature that consumes real server data (Phase 1+).
- **`@types/node` added** (dev-only) — `playwright.config.ts` reads
  `process.env.CI`, which needs Node's type definitions to type-check.
  Node.js itself is already in the Technical Stack (§9); this is only its
  types, not a new runtime dependency.
- **pnpm's build-script approval** (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`,
  `allowBuilds: { esbuild: true }`) — pnpm 11 blocks postinstall scripts
  by default; `esbuild` is Vite's own transitive dependency, not a new
  technology, so its build script was explicitly allowlisted rather than
  silently skipped (which would leave Vite partially broken).
- **Settings' sidebar placement** — `TRADEOS_FRONTEND_BLUEPRINT.md` §4.1
  doesn't explicitly group "Settings" among Workspace/Analytics/
  Configuration, nor does it say "no sidebar entry" the way it does for
  Login/Register (§5.7). Given every other confirmed module in §4.1 does
  get a sidebar entry, Settings was placed as its own minimal group rather
  than omitted — a reasonable reading, not an explicit document
  instruction, flagged here for visibility.

### Verification performed
- `pnpm install` — 438 packages installed cleanly (after allowlisting
  `esbuild`'s build script).
- `pnpm typecheck` (`tsc -b --noEmit`) — clean, after adding `@types/node`.
- `pnpm lint` (ESLint) — clean, after fixing one `react/no-unescaped-entities`
  violation in `PlaceholderPage.tsx`.
- `pnpm format:check` (Prettier) — clean.
- `pnpm test` (Vitest) — 5 passed.
- `pnpm build` (`tsc -b && vite build`) — succeeded; `dist/` output
  169.98 kB JS / 7.40 kB CSS (gzip 55.42 kB / 2.11 kB).
- `pnpm test:e2e` (Playwright, Chromium) — 2 passed.

### Deferred
- Every module's real page content, forms, tables, charts — Phase 1+.
- TanStack Query, Radix UI, React Hook Form, Zod, Recharts, TanStack
  Table, date-fns, Sonner, lucide-react — all tied to features this
  sprint explicitly excludes.
- Theme switching (light theme) — dark is the only theme designed in
  detail today (§14); `class="dark"` is applied statically, no
  `UserPreferences`-driven toggle yet (that's Settings' real
  implementation, Phase 1).

### Post-approval quality review
A dedicated pass for dead code, placeholder consistency, HTTP-contract
isolation, and unused Design System tokens, requested before commit:

- **Unused tokens found and fixed:** `--color-accent`, `--color-warning`,
  and `--color-success` were defined in `tokens.css` and mapped in
  `tailwind.config.ts`, but no component actually used any of them as a
  Tailwind class. Fixed two ways — `accent` was given a real, current
  consumer (the active-nav-link indicator in `Sidebar.tsx`, a left
  border); `warning`/`success` were removed entirely, since nothing in
  Sprint 0.3's shell-only scope needs profit/loss/warning semantics yet
  (no forms, no P&L display, no toasts). They get added when a real
  consumer exists, not speculatively.
- **HTTP-contract isolation confirmed:** `fetch()`, the API base URL, and
  the raw (`snake_case`) error envelope shape appear only in
  `src/api/client.ts`, `src/api/errors.ts`, and their own test files.
  Every UI component (`ErrorBanner`, `ErrorContext`, pages, layout) only
  ever touches the already-normalized `ApiError` class
  (`error.code`/`error.message`/`error.traceId`), never the wire format.
  One narrow, documented exception: `src/test-support/errorSimulation.ts`
  constructs a simulated envelope so the E2E test can exercise the real
  `parseApiError` path end to end — it is test scaffolding, not a UI
  component, and it calls the real parser rather than bypassing it.
- **Placeholder consistency confirmed:** all 10 module pages are
  structurally identical — each imports and renders the same
  `PlaceholderPage` component with only its `title` prop differing.
- **No dead files/imports found** beyond one expected case:
  `src/api/client.ts` (the API client layer) has no current caller, since
  no feature module exists yet to call it — this is the sprint's own
  explicit deliverable ("the API client layer"), not leftover code, the
  same status `create_access_token` had after Sprint 0.2.
- Re-ran `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` (5 passed), and
  `pnpm build` after the token fix — all clean. Also re-ran
  `pnpm test:e2e` (2 passed) since `Sidebar.tsx` was touched, though not
  explicitly requested.

## Sprint 1.1 — Identity Backend

Phase 1 of the Implementation Master Plan. Scope: Register/Login/Refresh/Logout
Use Cases (`TRADEOS_BACKEND_BLUEPRINT.md` §4.8) and the `identity.user_accounts`
table (`TRADEOS_DATABASE_DESIGN.md` §6.1) — backend only; Preferences and the
Login/Register frontend pages are Sprint 1.2, untouched here.

### `identity.refresh_tokens` — a documented, approved extension of the frozen schema

**This is the most consequential decision of this sprint, so it is
recorded here in full.** `TRADEOS_API_SPECIFICATION.md` §4.3 requires
refresh tokens to be:
- issued alongside the access token at login,
- **single-use** (exchanging one invalidates it and issues a new one —
  rotation),
- **revocable server-side** (to support `POST /auth/logout`).

All three properties are impossible to implement without persisting
refresh-token state somewhere. `TRADEOS_DATABASE_DESIGN.md` — the frozen,
canonical schema document — defines only `identity.user_accounts` for the
`identity` schema; it names no table for refresh tokens anywhere. This was
identified as a genuine documentation omission (not a signal to build
stateless refresh tokens) and confirmed explicitly by the user before any
code was written.

**Resolution:** `identity.refresh_tokens` was added via migration `0002`,
following the exact conventions `TRADEOS_DATABASE_DESIGN.md` §6.1 already
establishes for `user_accounts` (application-generated UUID primary key,
`TIMESTAMPTZ` throughout, and — mirroring `password_hash`, never
`password` — a `token_hash` column that stores only a hash of the token,
never the raw secret):

```
identity.refresh_tokens
  id            UUID PK
  user_id       UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES identity.user_accounts(id)
  token_hash    VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE
  issued_at     TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
  expires_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL
  revoked_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NULL
```

All refresh-token logic (hashing, rotation, revocation, the repository)
lives entirely inside `app/modules/identity/` — no other module imports or
knows about any of it.

### Added
- `app/modules/identity/domain/user_account.py`, `refresh_token.py` —
  `UserAccount` (Domain Model §8.11) and `RefreshToken` (with `is_valid()`/
  `revoke()` domain logic, unit-tested without a database).
- `app/modules/identity/infrastructure/models.py` — `UserAccountModel`,
  `RefreshTokenModel`, using SQLAlchemy 2.0's typed `Mapped`/`mapped_column`
  style (see Implementation notes).
- `app/modules/identity/infrastructure/password_hasher.py` — Argon2id
  (`TRADEOS_TECHNICAL_STACK.md` §7.2).
- `app/modules/identity/infrastructure/token_hasher.py` — SHA-256 for
  refresh-token lookup hashing, deliberately not Argon2id (see
  Implementation notes).
- `app/modules/identity/infrastructure/repository.py` —
  `UserAccountRepository`, `RefreshTokenRepository`.
- `app/modules/identity/application/register.py`, `login.py`, `refresh.py`,
  `logout.py`, `token_issuance.py` — the four Use Cases plus a shared
  token-pair-issuance helper (used by both Login and Refresh, so issuance
  is never duplicated).
- `app/modules/identity/presentation/schemas.py`, `router.py` — the four
  endpoints, matching `TRADEOS_API_SPECIFICATION.md` §6.1 field-for-field.
- `alembic/versions/0002_create_identity_schema.py` — the `identity`
  schema, both tables.
- `tests/identity/` — unit tests (password hashing, token hashing,
  `RefreshToken.is_valid()`) and `test_auth_flow.py`, an integration test
  running the real FastAPI app (middleware included) against a real
  Postgres instance: the full Register→Login→Refresh→Logout flow, the
  Master Plan's own named regression test ("refresh-token rotation reuse
  is rejected"), logout revocation, duplicate-email 409, identical
  wrong-password/unknown-email 401, and password-never-in-response.

### Modified
- `app/platform/errors.py` — added `ConflictError` (409) and a
  `RequestValidationError` handler (422, `VALIDATION_FAILED`, reshaping
  FastAPI/Pydantic's own error body into the one envelope). Both are
  generic, cross-cutting infrastructure — neither reveals anything about
  refresh-token internals — needed now because Sprint 1.1 is the first
  sprint with real request bodies and real business-conflict cases to
  report.
- `app/platform/config.py`, `.env.example` — added
  `refresh_token_expire_days` (default 30 — see Implementation notes).
- `app/main.py` — registers the Identity router at `/api/v1`; added
  `/api/v1/auth/register`, `/login`, `/refresh` to
  `AuthenticationMiddleware`'s `public_paths` (designed for exactly this
  in Sprint 0.2) — `/auth/logout` deliberately excluded, since it requires
  a valid access token.
- `alembic/env.py`, `tests/conftest.py` — import Identity's models and
  create the `identity` schema alongside `platform`.
- `pyproject.toml` — `pydantic` now installed with its `email` extra
  (`email-validator`), needed for `EmailStr`. Approved as dependency
  support for already-mandatory Pydantic, not a new technology decision.

### Implementation decisions (documented per your instructions, not silently made)
- **Password minimum length: 8 characters.** `TRADEOS_API_SPECIFICATION.md`
  §6.1 says "minimum length per Section 9 validation rules," but §9 never
  states a concrete number. 8 is a temporary implementation default,
  applied via Pydantic's `Field(min_length=8)` — **to be replaced once the
  specification states a value explicitly**, not treated as a permanent
  answer.
- **Refresh token expiry: 30 days**, and **access token expiry: 30
  minutes** (unchanged from Sprint 0.2). `TRADEOS_API_SPECIFICATION.md`
  §4.1 requires a refresh token to be "longer-lived" than the access token
  but gives no exact durations for either.
- **Logout's interpretation:** `POST /auth/logout`'s contract
  (`TRADEOS_API_SPECIFICATION.md` §6.1) has no request body — the only
  data available is the authenticated caller's `user_id`. Since a user can
  hold more than one active refresh token (multiple devices/tabs) and the
  contract gives no way to identify one specific session, logout is
  implemented as "revoke every currently-active refresh token for this
  user." This is an interpretation, not a literal instruction — no frozen
  document resolves this ambiguity either way.
- **`token_hash` uses SHA-256, not Argon2id.** Argon2id is correct for
  password *verification* (compare a plaintext against one known stored
  hash) but unsuited to refresh-token *lookup* (`SELECT ... WHERE
  token_hash = ?`), which requires a deterministic digest — Argon2id's
  per-call random salt makes the same input hash differently every time.
  SHA-256 (Python's stdlib `hashlib`, no new dependency) is the standard,
  correct tool for this different problem.
- **SQLAlchemy models use the typed `Mapped`/`mapped_column` style**
  (SQLAlchemy 2.0), not the legacy `Column(...)` style Sprint 0.1's
  `EventLog` model uses. This was a real `mypy` finding, not a stylistic
  preference: the legacy style is untyped from mypy's perspective, and
  `repository.py` reads rows straight back into strictly-typed domain
  dataclasses, which the legacy style cannot satisfy. `EventLog` itself
  was left unchanged (out of this sprint's scope; it never hits the same
  typed round-trip).

### Verification performed
- `poetry lock` / `poetry install` — `email-validator` + `dnspython`
  installed cleanly (transitive, via Pydantic's `email` extra).
- `alembic upgrade head` — `0001 -> 0002` applied; both tables confirmed
  via direct `psql` inspection (columns, PK, unique indexes, FK).
- `pytest tests/` — **31 passed** (17 new: 8 integration + 9 unit; 14
  carried over from Sprints 0.1–0.2). No regressions.
- `ruff format --check` / `ruff check` — clean.
- `mypy app` — clean, after the `Mapped`/`mapped_column` fix.

### Deferred
- `UserPreferences`, Login/Register frontend pages, Settings — Preferences
  page (Sprint 1.2).
- Roles/permissions, multi-session-aware logout, Domain Events for
  Identity actions (`BE-1`, already registered as accepted-as-is by the
  Master Plan) — none part of this sprint's approved scope.
